# Implement Phase 1: 3D Physics Framework

## Goal Description
Start the development of the "Lotto Soccer Team" 3D Match Engine by establishing the core physics layer.
As per `3D_축구_매치_엔진_개발_문서화.md`, the first step is to implement realistic ball ballistics using Unity's PhysX and a custom Magnus effect script.

## User Review Required
> [!NOTE]
> This plan focuses purely on the physics foundation (Ball). It does not yet include AI or Player Movement.

## Proposed Changes

### Assets/Game/Scripts/Physics
#### [NEW] [BallAerodynamics.cs](file:///d:/unity/workspace/로또축구단/Assets/Game/Scripts/Physics/BallAerodynamics.cs)
- Implement `MagnusForce` calculation based on angular velocity and velocity.
- Apply force to the Rigidbody in `FixedUpdate`.
- Expose `magnusCoefficient` for tuning.

#### [NEW] [BallPhysicsConfig.cs](file:///d:/unity/workspace/로또축구단/Assets/Game/Scripts/Physics/BallPhysicsConfig.cs)
- A ScriptableObject or Singleton to hold global physics constants (Air density, etc) if needed, or simply keep it within BallAerodynamics for now. (Standardizing on `BallAerodynamics` first).

### Assets/Game/Prefabs
#### [NEW] [Ball.prefab](file:///d:/unity/workspace/로또축구단/Assets/Game/Prefabs/Ball.prefab)
- **Rigidbody Settings**:
    - Mass: 0.43kg (FIFA standard)
    - Drag: 0.5 (Tune for air resistance)
    - Angular Drag: 0.8
    - Collision Detection: Continuous Dynamic
- **Collider**: SphereCollider
- **Material**: `SoccerBall` (PhysicMaterial)

### Assets/Game/PhysicsMaterials
#### [NEW] [SoccerBall.physicMaterial](file:///d:/unity/workspace/로또축구단/Assets/Game/PhysicsMaterials/SoccerBall.physicMaterial)
- Bounciness: 0.7
- Dynamic Friction: 0.6
- Static Friction: 0.6
- Friction Combine: Average
- Bounce Combine: Average (or Maximum based on testing)

#### [NEW] [Grass.physicMaterial](file:///d:/unity/workspace/로또축구단/Assets/Game/PhysicsMaterials/Grass.physicMaterial)
- Bounciness: 0.1
- Friction: High (0.6-0.8)

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- None at this stage (Unity Physics is hard to unit test without a PlayMode test runner setup, dependent on user environment).

### Manual Verification
1.  **Scene Setup**: Create a test scene `Assets/Game/Scenes/PhysicsTest.unity`.
2.  **Ball Drop Test**: Place the Ball prefab in the air. Verify it falls and bounces realistically on a Plane with `Grass` material.
3.  **Magnus Effect Test**:
    - Add a script `TestKicker.cs` that applies a strong forward force + strong side spin (torque) to the ball.
    - Run the scene.
    - Observe if the ball curves in the air (Banana shoot).
    - If it curves, the Magnus effect is working.
